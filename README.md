## About Project

A real time chat room application that can be used to communicate with anyone across the internet. In its current version (v.1.0) mobile view is **not** supported and only text based messages are supported. 

This was created using React, Node.js, Express.js and Socket.IO. **Learn more about them here:**
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/)
* [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
* [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/)

This application also supports the use of emojis 😀😁😂🤣 in chat thanks to [react-emojify]( https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-emojify).

## Initializing and Setting Up the Project Locally

In the project directory, you can run:

Clone or download the project repository on your machine and then navigate to the [client](https://github.com/ThomasAsuncion/Real-Time-JS-Chat-Room/tree/master/client) directory in a terminal and run the command `npm install` to install all the necessary dependencies. Navigate to the the [server](https://github.com/ThomasAsuncion/Real-Time-JS-Chat-Room/tree/master/server) directory in a terminal and run the command `npm install` to install all the necessary dependencies.

Once all the dependencies have been installed, run `npm start` in both the client and server directories to start the project. The client should run on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and the server should run on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) on your browser.
